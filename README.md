# Twice-Nice
There are many people who are fond of reading books yet, unable to do so because the new books are costly. Academic books are one section of the market which has not been properly explored by any company, and is still governed by small shops in the vicinity of schools and colleges. 
It is found through various survey results that people are also comfortable with reading old books (the ones already read by someone else). 
Hence, the website aims at providing all such people who would like to read their favourite titles in old used books, an online portal where they can order books at cheaper costs.
